# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the performance of various models (imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries) to understand the performance of the models and to make a recommendation of whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results
The balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machines where analyzed. The results were as follows:

### Naive Random Oversampling
